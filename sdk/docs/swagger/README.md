**Getting Started with Swagger**
==================
Swagger is a professional way to publish your REST API's.

 - To see an example of IoT Service API's go [here](https://markreha.github.io/cloudworkshop/sdk/docs/swagger/site/index.html).
 - The Swagger Online Editer can be found [here](http://editor.swagger.io). You can import the Swagger API file that is found in this repository into the Swagger Online Editor.
 - The Swagger UI can be found [here](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). The site [here](https://markreha.github.io/cloudworkshop/sdk/docs/swagger/site/index.html) was built with Swagger UI.
