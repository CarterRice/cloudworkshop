**Cloud and IoT Workshop SDK**
==================
The Cloud and IoT Workshop SDK contains all the documentation, sample applications (REST Services and Reporting), and Raspberry Pi Sensor HAT application required to build a simple, scalable, cloud based IoT suite of applications.

Folder Contents
--------
- The 'developer' folder: contains starter Java Spring and PHP Laravel template projects
- The 'docs' folder: contains Database, JavaDoc, PhpDoc, and Architecture documentation, you should start here
- The 'pi' folder: contains sample Raspberry Pi Sensor HAT and discrete IoT applications
- The 'tools' folder: contains misc. documentation generation tools

Getting Started
--------
You should start by first reading the architecture and Java/Doc as well as PhpDoc files. And then make sure you are comfortable with the following technologies/frameworks:
1) Cloud IoT Services: Java, Spring Framework (Core, Security, JDBC), Maven, and JAX-RS.
2) Cloud IoT App: Laravel PHP
3) Tooling: Github, SourceTree, Eclipse Neon (Java EE and PHP), PostMan

Next Steps
--------
After you are become familiar with the architecture, sample applications, and tools you can start building your own IoT applications using the sample reference applications in the SDK as a guide. As a developer, there are application build instructions for doing all development in the cloud based Cloudenvy IDE or desktop Eclipse Neon IDE. All code is maintained in the Github cloud based source control system and deployed to the OpenShift PaaS cloud. See the README file and Cloud Setup Notes file located in the developer folder to get started building your IoT application.
