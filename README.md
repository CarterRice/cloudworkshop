**Getting Started with the Cloud and IoT Workshop SDK**
==================
The Cloud and IoT Workshop SDK contains all the documentation, and sample applications (REST Services, Reporting, and Raspberry Pi Sense HAT) required to build a simple, scalable, Cloud based suite of IoT applications.

Folder Contents
--------
The SDK is organized into a number of folders. It should be noted that all directories in this markup are indicated in bold italic text.
 - The '[***developer***](#developer-directory-contents)' folder: contains starter Java Spring and PHP Laravel template projects 
 - The '[***docs***](#docs-directory-contents)' folder: contains Database, JavaDoc, PhpDoc, and Architecture documentation, you should start here 
 - The '[***pi***](#pi-directory-contents)' folder: contains sample Raspberry Pi Sense HAT application and discrete component IoT applications 
 - The '[***tools***](#tools-directory-contents)' folder: contains misc. documentation generation tools

Getting Started
--------
You should start by first reading the Architecture decks and Java/Doc as well as PhpDoc files all located in the docs directory in the SDK. And then make sure you are comfortable with the following technologies/frameworks:
1) Cloud IoT Services App (published REST API's): Java, Spring Framework (Core, Security, JDBC), Maven, and JAX-RS.
2) Cloud IoT Reporting App: Laravel PHP, LavaCharts, Guzzle
3) Tooling: Github, SourceTree, Eclipse Neon (Java EE and PHP), Tomcat 8.5, PostMan

Tools Install
--------
You will need to download and install the following tools:
1. Eclipse Neon for Java EE platform: www.eclipse.org OR use cloud based the Codenvy IDE
2. Eclipse Neon for PHP platform: www.eclipse.org OR use the cloud based Codenvy IDE
3. Tomcat 8.5: www.apache.org OR use the cloud based Codenvy IDE
4. SourceTree: www.sourcetreeapp.com OR use the Chrome Browser
5. PostMan: www.getpostman.org OR use the Chrome Plugin

Next Steps
--------
After you are become familiar with the architecture, sample applications, and tools you can start building your own IoT applications using the sample reference applications in the SDK as a guide. As a developer, there are application build instructions for doing all development in the cloud based Cloudenvy IDE or desktop Eclipse Neon IDE. All code is maintained in the Github cloud based source control system and deployed to the OpenShift PaaS cloud. See the README file and Cloud Setup Notes text file located in the docs/development folder to get started building your own IoT applications.
